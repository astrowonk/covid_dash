### Covid Case Growth

Plots are normalized per 100K population. Data is preprocessed/merged with census population data with R scripts twice a day. More details on data sources in the About section below. 

All Covid case data comes from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html), which hosts the data on [their github repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

Code is all available on [github](https://github.com/astrowonk/covid_dash).
