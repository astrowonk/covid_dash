# Covid-19 Per Capita New Case in Dash
[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) app showing Covid new cases by state/county.

This app implements per-capita normalized plots of linear case growth of Covid-19, using data from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).

I have rewritten the downloaded and merge scripts with python/pandas. The files are downloaded and merged twice a day in for the app when running live at [my web site](https://marcoshuerta.com/dash/covid/).
